# Issue Templates for Teachers

This directory contains GitHub issue template forms designed to help teachers easily request changes and improvements to the Mergington High School Activities website.

## Available Templates

When you create a new issue, you'll be presented with these template options:

### üêõ Bug Report
Use this when something isn't working correctly on the website. The form will guide you through describing the problem, what should happen instead, and how to reproduce the issue.

### ‚ú® Feature Request
Use this to suggest new features or enhancements. You'll provide details about what you want, why it's needed, and clear acceptance criteria so developers know when it's complete.

### üé® UI/Design Enhancement
Use this for visual or design changes, such as color scheme updates, layout improvements, or school branding additions. Perfect for requests like adding dark mode or updating to school colors.

### üìö Documentation Update
Use this when documentation needs to be added, updated, or corrected. This includes README files, setup guides, or API documentation.

### üéØ New Activity Request

## How to Use

1. Go to the **Issues** tab in the repository
2. Click **New Issue**
3. Select the appropriate template
4. Fill out all required fields (marked with *)
5. Optional fields provide additional context but aren't mandatory
6. Submit the issue
7. Assign to **@copilot** to have the AI coding agent handle it automatically!

## What Makes These Templates Special

Each template is designed with GitHub Copilot in mind, collecting:
- **Clear problem descriptions** - So Copilot understands what needs to be done
- **Acceptance criteria** - So Copilot knows when the task is complete
- **Technical hints** - Optional guidance on implementation approaches
- **Context and constraints** - Any limitations or requirements to consider

This structured approach means you don't need to be a programmer to request changes effectively. Just fill out the form, and Copilot can handle the implementation!

## Tips for Best Results

- **Be specific**: The more details you provide, the better Copilot can help
- **Use examples**: Reference other websites or provide mockups when possible
- **Include context**: Explain why the change is needed
- **Set priorities**: Help us understand what's most important
- **Add screenshots**: A picture is worth a thousand words!
